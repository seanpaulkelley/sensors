# README

My first project using Ruby on Rails 5 api version for server and Ember-cli for client side.

This app graphs sensor readings from a couple of Raspberry Pis to track earthworm bin soil temperature, outside temperature, outside humidity (coming), plant grafting chamber humidity, and plant grafting chamber temperature.  Additionally, I added in planting datbase based on North Carolina State planting calendar at https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/central-north-carolina-planting-calendar-for-annual-vegetables-fruits-and-herbs.


Steps to get setup:

* This go me going setting up the rails <=> ember communication @ https://emberigniter.com/modern-bridge-ember-and-rails-5-with-json-api/

* However, I wanted an integrated rails/ember evironment as opposed to two separate projects so I used the ember-cli-rails gem @ https://github.com/thoughtbot/ember-cli-rails.
